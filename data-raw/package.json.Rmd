To generate package.json and in light of discussions under [ticket #61](), documenting how package.json was generated. Also plans to replace current method of adding the deps and dev deps in package.json of a `geoplumber` app.

```{bash}
# from /tmp
# name is important as gp_create relies on 
# geoplumber being default name in package.json
npx create-react-app geoplumber
cat blah/package.json
# add deps
npm i prop-types react-bootstrap leaflet react-leaflet react-leaflet-control react-router react-router-dom

# add devs
npm i --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 sinon react-test-renderer
# copy package.json into geoplumber/inst/js
```
