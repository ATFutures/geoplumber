`geoplumber` depends only on [`plumber`](https://www.rplumber.io) R package to enable building web applications using R and currently ReactJS. It uses `npm` but this is by no means a preference. It is a rapid development available skill utilisation choice.

Currently there is no database at the backend, this is simply because we are at the beginning of this process and there will be need to use one or more. Therefore, as things stand it is a two tier architecture and prefers the `flux` one. That is data flow should be one directional and follow the "React" paradigm.

In terms of npm pacakges, it relies on Facebook's ["create-react-app"](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) `npm` package to create the basic structure of the front end. But there is basic code to replace this and assemble a React package as it will be demonstrated in this vignette.

In terms of web mapping, the landscape is not huge. Being an open source pacakge, we chose the simplicity of [`Leaflet`](https://leafletjs.com/). Thanks to [`react-leaflet`](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) this was straightforward to integrate into a [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) app.

## Getting started
So given some dataset such as the `traffic` included in this package let us get a web application up and running where we can see some `geojson` data on a map.

```{r traffic}
library(geoplumber)
html_file = gp_map(traffic, browse_map = FALSE, dest_path = getwd())
htmltools::includeHTML(html_file)
```

```{r hidden, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
file.remove(html_file)
```

As the default `gp_create` function uses `create-react-app`, let us assemble an app using `gp_cra_init`:

```{r gp_cra_init}
path = file.path(tempdir(), "new_app")
# make sure that exists
dir.create(path)
gp_cra_init(path = path)
# check if that is the case
gp_is_wd_geoplumber(path = path)

```

Now that `path` is a valid `geoplumber` application, quick look into it:
```{r gp-app-structure}
list.files(path)
list.files(file.path(path, "R"))
```

Quickly, the `package.json` file is standard `yarn` or `npm` node package file where various settings live for Node to manager our package, as the directory is now a valid node package. The `public` is the static "public" directory for `css`, custom `js` and conventionally the entry point `index.html` to live and in future possibly for our deployed front-end to live. Finally, the `src` is where all React components and our `geoplumber` front-end will be built from. Again, this could all change as `geoplumber` flourishes.

Quick peek:

```{r src-list}
list.files(file.path(path, "src"))
```


The `R/plumber.R` is the only backend script that would be executed in a fresh geoplumber app. This could change, based on the documentations in [`plumber`](https://www.rplumber.io) and also as `geoplumber` grows. Using the underlying `plumber` package, we can inspect what is in the `R/plumber.R` file:

```{r plumber.R}
# we must change dir into a gp path
ow <- setwd(path)
r <- gp_plumb(run = FALSE)
length(r$endpoints[[1]]) # it should be 5
```

There is a default endpoint where a message is echoed by the server, we can test this using:

```{r plumber.R2}
response <- r$endpoints[[1]][[1]]$exec()
response$msg # it should be: "The message is: 'nothing given'"
```

### serve data

This is the last lines of the `R/plumber.R` file, as stated above, makes up the backend:

```{r cat-plumber.R}
ow <- setwd(path)
tail(readLines("R/plumber.R"))
```

We can add the following to the end of the file and rerun `gp_plumb`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
#' Serve geoplumber::traffic from /api/data           
#' @get /api/data   
get_traffic <- function(res) {                        
  geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(geoplumber::traffic)
  res$body <- geojson 
  res
}
```
For a break down of the above chunk go to the section ([End-point explained]) explaining it.

```{r hidden2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
ow <- setwd(path)
plumberR <- "R/plumber.R"
if(!file.exists(plumberR)) {
  stop("Error: cannot find R/plumber.R file.")
}
# write
endpoint <- c(
 "#' vignette added endpoint",
 "#'",
 "#' Serve geoplumber::traffic from /api/data",
 "#' @get /api/data",
 "get_traffic <- function(res) {",
 "  geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(geoplumber::traffic)",
 "  res$body <- geojson",
 "  res",
 "}"
 )
write(endpoint, file = plumberR, append = TRUE)
```
Let us use a helper function from `geoplumber` called `gp_endpoint_from_clip`:

```{r gp_endpoint_from_clip, eval=FALSE}
ow <- setwd(path)
old_clip <- clipr::read_clip()
# adding below to clipboard
clipr::write_clip(c(
 "#' vignette added endpoint",
 "#'",
 "#' Serve geoplumber::traffic from /api/data",
 "#' @get /api/data",
 "get_traffic <- function(res) {",
 "  geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(geoplumber::traffic)",
 "  res$body <- geojson",
 "  res",
 "}"
 ))
gp_endpoint_from_clip()
clipr::write_clip(old_clip)
```
check if that worked:
```{r cat-plumber.R2}
ow <- setwd(path)
tail(readLines("R/plumber.R"))
```

That did work. Now, we should have an extra endpoint:
```{r plumber.R3, message=FALSE}
# we must change dir into a gp path
ow <- setwd(path)
r <- gp_plumb(run = FALSE)
length(r$endpoints[[1]]) # it should now be 6
```

Now, we cannot simulate the last endpoint by executing it as we have done above. But if you would like to run `gp_plumb`, you should now have `geojson` object returned to you if you visit `localhost:8000/api/data` URL on your browser or `curl` it.

What about the front end? Well, we need to consume that URL somehow. There is few functions to assist with composing React components. One of them is called `gp_add_geojson` which takes a URL and can "render" the data from it:

```{r gp_add_geojson}
ow <- setwd(path)
gp_add_geojson(endpoint = "/api/data") # which is the default
```
A peek into the main React component called "Welcome" to see if we have a component called `GeoJSONComponent`:
```{r cat-plumber.R3}
ow <- setwd(path)
tail(readLines("src/Welcome.js"))
```

Yep, that looks good. We are now ready to build our front end and consume the data served from the R backend:

```{r npm-i, eval=FALSE}
ow <- setwd(path)
gp_build()
## Running: npm run build
## Looks like first run, installing npm packages...
## Running: gp_npm_install()
## Now trying to build: npm run build
## Standard output from create-react-app above works.
## To run the geoplumber app: gp_plumb()
```

Now, we have installed the required dependencies of the npm package and we can run the application using:

```{r finally, eval=FALSE}
gp_plumb()
# visit localhost:8000 to see the application
```

## Adding colour and linewidth to a remote geojson data.
There is a geojson [file](https://d2ad6b4ur7yvpq.cloudfront.net/naturalearth-3.3.0/ne_110m_rivers_lake_centerlines.geojson) which includes world's rivers. Please run this example remembering to have `colourvalues` R package. 

We can read it into a dataframe, add a "colour" column, then add another "lwd" column and tell `geoplumber` to use them to colour and draw them accordingly.

```{r add_geojson_rivers, eval=FALSE}
path = file.path(tempdir(), "rivers") # new geoplumber app 
dir.create(path)
gp_is_wd_geoplumber(path)
#> [1] FALSE
gp_cra_init(path = path)
gp_is_wd_geoplumber(path)
#> [1] TRUE

od = setwd(path)

# adding the necessary code to the plumber.R file.
write(c("#' Rivers example", 
        "rivers <- geojsonsf::geojson_sf('https://d2ad6b4ur7yvpq.cloudfront.net/naturalearth-3.3.0/ne_110m_rivers_lake_centerlines.geojson')",
        "rivers <- rivers[, c('name', 'geometry')]",
        "n <- nrow(rivers)",
        "m <- grDevices::colorRamp(c('red', 'green'))( (1:n)/n )",
        "rivers$col <- colourvalues::colour_values(rivers$name, palette = m, include_alpha = F)",
        "rivers$lwd <- seq(5, 8, 0.5)",
        "#' now serve `rivers` object from /api/rivers",
        "#' @get /api/rivers",
        "get_rivers <- function(res) {",
        "geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(rivers, factors_as_string = TRUE)",
        "res$body <- geojson",
        "res",
        "}"), file = "R/plumber.R", append = TRUE)
tail(readLines("R/plumber.R"))
#> [1] "#' @get /api/rivers"                                               
#> [2] "get_rivers <- function(res) {"                                     
#> [3] "geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(rivers, factors_as_string = TRUE)"
#> [4] "res$body <- geojson"                                               
#> [5] "res"                                                               
#> [6] "}"
gp_add_geojson(endpoint = "/api/rivers",
               color = "col", # matching above rivers$col
               line_weight = "lwd",
               properties = TRUE)
#> Remember to rebuild frontend: gp_build()
#> Success.

gp_build()
#> Running: npm run build
#> Looks like first run, installing npm packages...
#> Running: gp_npm_install()
#> Now trying to build: npm run build
#> Standard output from create-react-app above works.
#> To run the geoplumber app: gp_plumb()
# gp_plumb()
setwd(od)
```

If you now run the `gp_plumb` function you should see something similar to the following image in your browser. The reason, you could guess, is that the front end JavaScript code takes into account a colour value and also passes the `lwd` to the appropriate styling to the underlying Leaflet API.
```{r rivers-image, fig.keep=TRUE, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="World's rivers coloured and random linewidth assigned using code in above chunk"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/408568/52061758-f80cef80-2566-11e9-9a0c-d9db6aa044a9.png")
```


## Analysing an sf object

## Adding front end React components

```{r cleanup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
setwd(ow)
unlink(path, recursive = TRUE)
```

## Underlying stack

As geoplumber uses both R and Node, currently R v3.4 is the minimum, we will do all we can to make it backward compatible both in R and node. As for node, whatever the needs of Facebook's `create-react-app` is. For instructions on installing node on your OS please refer to the [NodeJS official docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

### End-point explained
```{r eval=FALSE}
#' Serve geoplumber::traffic from /api/data             (1)
#' @get /api/data                                       
get_traffic <- function(res) {                        # (3)
  geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(geoplumber::traffic)
  res$body <- geojson                                 # (5)
  res
}
```
Let us go through this, though you would need a better understanding of `pulmber` to be able to understand exactly what is going on.

(1) Just a comment using conventional R style.

(2) `plumber` markup, `@get` is translated into a http GET request, the space allows the parser to recognise what is coming next which is the URL or the local path to the root URL. In this case `/api/data`. Current version of `plumber` is sensitive to the ending slash.

(3) Conventional R function definition but has `res` parameter in it. This is passed down by `plumber` and stands for the http `response` to be sent back to the client.

(4) R package `geojsonsf` lightening fast converts our `dataframe` object `traffic` into a single string `geojson` object.

(5) We implicitly make the response a `json` response by populating the body of the response with the object from (4).
Finally, we return the response so that `plumber` can return it to the client.
