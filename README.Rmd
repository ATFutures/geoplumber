# What is geoplumber?

geoplumber is R package that extends [`plumber`](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber), which was designed for creating web APIs with R.
It supports [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontends at present (it may support other frontend frameworks such as VueJS in the future) and geographic data, building on [`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).

In other words, geoplumber is a lightweight geographic data server, like a barebones version of [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) but with a smaller footprint (< 5MB rather than > 50MB download size) and easier installation, especially if you are already an R user, with the following command:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("ATFutures/geoplumber")
```


## Development

geoplumber is built for Unix systems, we aim to support Windows in future.

We have worked with Shiny and  [`plumber`](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber/) and we consider ourselves experienced in ReactJS, too. In order to put together a web application powered at the backend with R and React at the front-end, there is a lot of setup and boilerplate to put together. This would be also correct for other front end stack such as Angular or VueJS.

Currently geoplumber uses Facebook's `create-react-app` (CRA) npm package to deal with underlying app management (including building and running) to keep you up to date with updates. `geoplumber` will generally provide detailed installation instructions for all required `npm` packages, but if not, the following are minimally required:

```
sudo npm i -g create-react-app
```


<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- Currently repo is available only on github. To install the package using `devtools`: -->


<!-- geoplumber, like `devtools` and similar packages works by working directory. It does not currently create an `.Rproj` file but may do so in future. -->

```

## Usage

To create a new web application:
```{r create-example}
library(geoplumber)
gp_create("my_app")

```
This will create a `my_app` folder at your current working directory. Suppose you started an R session from a folder with path `/Users/ruser/`, you will have `/Users/ruser/my_app` on your machine. 

If you create an Rstudio project at `/Users/ruser/my_app` yourself, or an empty `my_app` directory, you can create a geoplumber app using:
`geoplumber::gp_create(".")`.

You can also give geoplumber a path including one ending with a new directory. Currently, geoplumber does not do any checks on this but the underlying CRA does.

You can then build the new project
```{r build-example}
library(geoplumber)
setwd("my_app")
gp_build() # the front end and create minified js files.

```

At this point, if you created an app using the above examples or set your working directory to a geoplumber app. You can then serve all endpoints and front end with one command:
`gp_plumb()` \# provide custom port if you wish, default is 8000

Then visit `localhost:8000` to see your app.

## Use case
Serve the `geoplumber::traffic` dataset (data.frame) at a "/api/data" endpoint, and view it on the front end. 

The `traffic` [dataset](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/southwark-traffic-counts) is from CDRC at University of Leeds which is traffic data locations for the larger traffic dataset.

To achive this copy the following endpoint/API to the clipboard of your machine. If you like to understand the function, you need to learn `plumber` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' Serve geoplumber::traffic from /api/data
#' @get /api/data
get_traffic <- function(res) {
  geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(geoplumber::traffic)
  res$body <- geojson
  res
}
```
Then run (re-copied into clipboard just in case):
```{r add-endpoint-manually}
setwd("my_app")
old_clip <- clipr::read_clip()
# adding above to clipboard
 clipr::write_clip(c(
 "#' Serve geoplumber::traffic from /api/data",
 "#' @get /api/data",
 "get_traffic <- function(res) {",
 "  geojson <- geojsonsf::sf_geojson(geoplumber::traffic)",
 "  res$body <- geojson",
 "  res",
 "}"
 ))
 gp_endpoint_from_clip()
 clipr::write_clip(old_clip)
```

This has now added a new endpoint at: `/api/data`. To consume it, we can simply run:

```{r add-geojson}
setwd("my_app")
gp_add_geojson("/api/data") # param value is default
```

You can now see the data by running:
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("my_app")
gp_build() # build changes
gp_plumb()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", fig.cap="CDRC London traffic data on geoplumber"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/gp.png")
```
You can also now see the raw JSON dataset at  `http://localhost:8000/api/data`,
and on a map on a browser view the map at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Endpoints

R package `plumber` comes with a default endpoint for documenting the API using Swagger. This is also available from `geoplumber`'s `/__swagger__/` path.

We follow a pattern of `/api/` before the endpoints and without for other URL's.
A new web app will have `/api/helloworld` and you can `curl` it:

```{sh eval=FALSE}
curl localhost:8000/api/helloworld
#> {"msg":["The message is: 'nothing given'"]}
```

## Test

Tests currently only apply to very restricted components of full functionality.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::test()
```
